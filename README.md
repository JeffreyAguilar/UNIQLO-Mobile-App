# UNIQLO Mobile App

I've designed and developed a mobile e-commerce application inspired by Uniqlo's app, focusing on key features and user experience. While not a direct replica, the project involved a detailed study of the original app's structure, UI/UX, and main functionalities. I implemented core features like product browsing, cart management, user accounts, checkout, and etc. This project enhanced my skills in mobile app development using Flutter/Dart, and innovative design implementation

## Introduction

This project was about creating a mobile e-commerce app, inspired by Uniqlo's current app, to showcase my ability to design and develop a proper UI/UX needed for the development of e-commerce apps. I looked at important functions like browsing products and checking out to make shopping easier.

## Features

-**Cross Platform**:
Built with Flutter, ensuring a seamless experience on both iOS and Android. (NOTE: Currently only optimized to run on iOS devices)

-**Simplified Shopping**:
Offers a product listing of various products that users can select. Once selected, users are taken into a simple product details screen and are able to add the product into their shopping cart.

-**Account Creation**:
Users are able to create accounts that are stored in a cloud firestore database and are able to edit the information within the app that change the data in firestore.

-**Location Based Services**:
Automatically fetches and displays nearby Uniqlo stores based on the user's current location and provides directions for users provided by Google Maps API.

## Installation

To get started with CityScope, follow these steps:

1. **Clone The Repository**
2. **Install Dependencies**
3. **Run the App**

## Usage

Once the app is installed and running, you will be free to view the products in the search tab. You will be urged to create an account in order to save customer details and save cart information. In the account tab, you will be able to view profile information, your order history, your wishlist, stores nearby, customer support, and settings. NOTE: Tabs like profile information, order history, and wishlist will require you to be signed in to view otherwise you will need to create an account first.
